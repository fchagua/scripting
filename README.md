This is a small project to learn and explore the usage of bash scripting


Installation
1. Use VS Code to create a new project folder
2. Install Ubuntu via Windows Store and set up Ubuntu (this step was performed because of Windows computer)
3. Check that Ubuntu is wokring via the command `wsl -l -v` in the terminal
4. Run bash file via the command `bash bashFile.sh` in the VS Code terminal of the project

System Paths
Inputing a path will require /mnt/c/Users... since the Windows System treats the Linux subsytem as a different OS.
